# Introduction

Integrating web components into existing framework applications can be difficult at times. More about this can be read at https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/.
To accommodate the various issues, the Rindo team has created new output target plugins to make the process simpler.

The plugins add additional output targets for each framework binding that is included.

Detailed information for each output target can be found in each package's README.
